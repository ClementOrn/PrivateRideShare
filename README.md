# Private Ride Share Platform

A privacy-preserving ride-sharing platform built with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling secure and anonymous transportation services on the blockchain.

## üîê Core Concepts

### FHE Anonymous Ride-Sharing System
This platform leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption to create a trustless ride-sharing ecosystem where sensitive data remains encrypted throughout the entire process. Passengers and drivers can interact without revealing their exact locations, fare preferences, or personal information to other parties.

### Privacy-First Transportation
- **Location Privacy**: Pickup and destination coordinates are encrypted using FHE
- **Fare Privacy**: Maximum and minimum fare preferences remain confidential
- **Identity Protection**: User interactions are pseudonymous through wallet addresses
- **Computational Privacy**: All matching algorithms operate on encrypted data

## üöó Features

### For Passengers
- **Anonymous Ride Requests**: Submit encrypted location data for rides
- **Private Fare Bidding**: Set maximum fare limits without revealing the amount
- **Secure Matching**: Get matched with drivers without location exposure
- **Ride History**: Track your transportation history privately

### For Drivers
- **Private Registration**: Register with encrypted location and fare preferences
- **Confidential Availability**: Update location and availability status securely
- **Encrypted Ride Acceptance**: Accept rides based on encrypted proximity calculations
- **Privacy-Preserved Earnings**: Complete rides with encrypted fare settlements

### Smart Contract Features
- **Encrypted State Management**: All sensitive data stored as encrypted values
- **Automatic Matching**: FHE-based algorithms for optimal passenger-driver pairing
- **Dispute Resolution**: On-chain dispute mechanisms for fare disagreements
- **Reputation System**: Track driver verification and ride completion statistics

## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Layer
- **Smart Contract**: Deployed on FHE-enabled blockchain network
